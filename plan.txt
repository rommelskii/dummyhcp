-- DummyHCP

-- Project Brief
This project is a single-threaded DHCP server made to lease IP addresses to multiple hosts in a single subnet.
The usage of DummyHCP is limited to only a single subnet, i.e., inter-VLAN routing via helper addresses
are not available for the scope of the project.

DummyHCP is built from C++17. The standalone libraries for socket programming are the only ones used.

-- Project Architecture
This project is separated between the server and client subprojects. However, a proper object schema must first
be defined. This schema is particularly referring to the procedural model of DHCP pools and packets.
Once these models and procedures are defined, progress can then be made for the server and client subprojects.

-- Server Subproject
The server contains the port listening logic and the standard business logic for IP leasing. The leasing
mechanism is simply an FCFS mechanism through an unordered map. Servers utilize DHCP pools that contain
a range of IP addresses that can be leased, the default gateway for the hosts, the network address and
its mask, pool name, and its lease table. The lease table contains the IP and MAC addresses of the end hosts
whose IP has been leased. The leasing business logic depends on the presence of addresses in the leasing
table in the form of an unordered map.

When receiving client requests, they provide an XID (session ID) that tracks a specific session between
the client and server. This has to be stored in some form of unordered map.

-- Client Subproject
The client program provides the submission of requests and the receipt of replies from the DHCP server.
Using the same models and procedures for the DHCP packets, the client can submit UDP requests via
broadcast. The client program can utilize a state-machine approach to the receipt of the options field.
Client metadata must be provided in the DHCP packet to be sent.

Milestones:
1. DHCP packet and pool models
2. Packet and pool procedures
