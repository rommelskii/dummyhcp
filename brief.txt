Foundation Filter 

-- Project Description
The Foundation Filter is a Raspbian-hosted containerized program that utilizes a web camera feed to present
a live view on a television via HDMI with detected faces and a "filter" overlay stamped over the detected faces.

-- Project Architecture
The Foundation Filter is a locally-hosted service to be run as a container in Docker. The container service will 
utilize the following:
1. OpenCV - Capturing frames from the live feed 
2. Mediapipe (optional if there is already a face detector on YOLO) - Pose estimation on face
3. YOLOv8 - For detecting faces in the feed
4. React - Front end for app
5. Chromium - Browser for running the app

For automatically running the container in device startup, we create a systemd target that will execute the container
initialization and operation. 

-- Developer Operations
All development testing and eventual deployment will result in Docker containers. The Docker containers
must be able to expose a port where the front end and the inferences can be shown in the live feed.

-- Program Logic
1. Housekeeping Step
- The program tests whether the live feed and the inference engine is working
2. Runtime loop 
- Receive frames at 24fps
- Per frame, perform an inference to find face coordinates (if any)
  - There are faces, place the filter on the available coordinates
  - If none, skip the inference
3. Shutdown
- The program will shut down if the device itself shuts down
